# Meme-Generator
Feel free to use this file to create memes via the command line! Run it with the command: python3 meme-ifier.py. From here, simply take a look at the list of 100 memes, note the serial number, and enter some fun text! The resulting meme will be saved as a .jpg file in the same directory. 

Note: The only thing you'll need to do is (in a separate .txt file or config file), create a free account with https://imgflip.com/ and store your username and password in the file (making sure to keep the file in the same directory (or updating the code to reflect where your credentials are kept).

Other than that, have fun!
